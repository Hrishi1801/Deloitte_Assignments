3.  What is setInterval()  and setTimeout() methods in JavaScript?

he window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.

These time intervals are called timing events.

The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.



4.  What are promisees in JavaScript? Why do we use?  

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that will produce a single value some time in the future. If the promise is successful, it will produce a resolved value, but if something goes wrong then it will produce a reason why the promise failed. The possible outcomes here are similar to that of promises in real life.
